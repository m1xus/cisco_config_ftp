# cisco_config_ftp.rb
This is basically a small rewrite of the existing MSF module auxiliary/scanner/snmp/cisco_config_tftp but tweaked slightly to support FTP as an alternative protocol for configuration retrieval.

## Quickstart
Place this module in your personal .msf/modules folder to load into MetaSploit.
